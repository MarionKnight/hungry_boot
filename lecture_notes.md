Lecture Topics:
---------------
- testing frameworks for Ruby/Sinatra: RSpec, Test-unit, Minitest, Bacon
- helpers: shoulda, rack-test, capybara
- TDD/BDD/EDD
- unit vs. integration vs. functional vs. acceptance test
unit test => single method / class, in isolation
integration test => interactions across classes / layers
functional test => end-to-end, full-stack, observable inputs & output
acceptance test => as user would interact with system; satisfies user requirement
- inside-out vs. outside-in
- mantras
Red-Green-Refactor
Only test code that you control (i.e. don't test libraries)
Call the method you wish you had


Demo psql:
psql -d[database_name]
\q
\l
\dt
good old familiar sql statements


Discuss new syntax/techniques, gems used, & other magic in code
